# Covid19Map_Application
Application is showing Covid19's deads.
I used Spring Web and Thymeleaf to create application showing amount of people sick on coronavirus 
(according to information from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv).
I combined Html, Java and JavaScript to see the effect.
