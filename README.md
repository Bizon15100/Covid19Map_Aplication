# Covid19Map_Application
Application is showing Covid19's deads.
I used Spring Web and Thymeleaf to create application showing amount of people sick on coronavirus 
(according to information from https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_deaths_global.csv).
I combined Html, Java and JavaScript to see the effect. 

Please download all code into your computer, run SpringbootMapInitApplication.class using Inteliij Idea Ultimate and in your internet browser write localhost:8080.
